# Terminology

* **CSECT** - Control Section.  Instructions in this section are allocated memory.  It is a relocatable module that can be link edited and executed.  Refer to **DSECT**.
* **DSECT** - Dummy Section.  Describes memory but doesn't allocated it. Refer to **CSECT**.

# Format of Assembly Language Program

Format   | Name  | Operation | Operands and commends | Continuation Field       
---------|-------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------
Position | 1-8   | 10-14     | 16-71                 | 72

* **Name** - the symbolic names used for references
* **Operation** - the **mnemonic opration code**, which are the assembly language and compiler instructions
* **Operands** - the operands used by the **Operation** instructions
* **Comments** - any comments must follow the Operand with at least one space in between
* **Continuation** - indicates the instruction is continued on the next line

# Instruction Set

## Instruction Set Overview

The Assesmbly language instruction set goes in the **Operation** column, they can be broken down into four groups:

* Data movement instructions
* Arithmetic instructions
* Logical instructions
* Input/output instructions

## Data Movement Instructions

* **MVC** - Move Character.  Moves data from the second operand to the first.  Ex., `MVC   op1,op2`
